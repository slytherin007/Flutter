# Understanding Flutter Scaffold

This repository provides a basic example demonstrating the usage of a scaffold widget in Flutter for building app layouts.

## What is a Scaffold?

In Flutter, a `Scaffold` is a fundamental widget used to create an app's basic structure by implementing the Material Design visual layout structure. It offers a layout framework for the overall structure of the app's user interface. It includes commonly used elements such as an app bar, a body area, floating action buttons (FABs), drawers, and more.

## Code Overview

The main focus of the code lies in:

- **`lib/main.dart`**: This file contains a basic Flutter app structure using a `Scaffold` widget.

### Understanding Scaffold Components

The scaffold's primary components are:

- **AppBar**: The top-level app bar that typically contains a title and various actions.
- **Body**: The main content area where widgets like `Container`, `Column`, `ListView`, etc., can be placed.
- **FloatingActionButton**: An optional button typically used for primary and high-priority actions.
- **Drawer**: A sliding panel displaying options or navigation items.
